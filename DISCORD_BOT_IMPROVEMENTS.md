# Discord Bot Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the MelonMC Discord bot to fix all issues and make it more reliable.

## 🛠️ Major Improvements

### 1. Robust Announcement System

- **Reliable Storage**: Announcements are now saved to multiple locations:
  - `discord-bot/data/announcements.json`
  - `Website/announcements/announcements.json`
  - `Website/admin/localStorage_backup.json`

- **Automatic Type Detection**: The system automatically categorizes announcements as:
  - 🔵 **Info** (default)
  - 🟢 **Update** (detected when "update", "version", or "new feature" are mentioned)
  - 🟠 **Warning** (detected when "warning", "caution", or "attention" are mentioned)
  - 🔴 **Critical** (detected when "critical", "emergency", or "urgent" are mentioned)

- **Improved Discord Integration**: The bot monitors your announcement channel and automatically processes new messages.

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- **Graceful Failures**: The bot now handles errors gracefully without crashing
- **Detailed Logging**: Improved console output with clear error messages
- **Auto-Recovery**: The start.bat script automatically restarts the bot if it crashes

### 3. Better Command System

- **Slash Commands**: All commands now use Discord's slash command system
- **Admin Verification**: Commands check for the admin role before execution
- **Helpful Feedback**: Commands provide detailed feedback on success or failure

### 4. Easy Setup and Configuration

- **Setup Scripts**: Added setup.bat for Windows users
- **Auto-Configuration**: Scripts automatically create necessary directories and files
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed README.md and TROUBLESHOOTING.md

## 📋 New Files

- **`start.bat`**: Easy launcher with automatic restart on crash
- **`setup.bat`**: Configures the bot environment, installs dependencies, and creates necessary files
- **`sync-all.js`**: Utility to bulk sync announcements from Discord
- **`generate-test-announcements.js`**: Creates test announcements for website testing
- **`README.md`**: Comprehensive documentation for setup and usage
- **`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`**: Common issues and their solutions

## 🔄 Updated Files

- **`main.js`**: Completely reworked with improved error handling and announcement processing
- **`commands.js`**: Simplified command handlers with consistent error handling
- **Environment Setup**: Improved .env file detection and creation

## 🚀 What's Now Working

1. **Announcement Syncing**: Announcements properly sync to the website
   - Both manual sync (via `/syncannouncements` command)
   - Automatic sync (real-time monitoring of the announcement channel)

2. **Command Registration**: All commands properly register and work with Discord

3. **Test Data**: You can generate test announcements with `node generate-test-announcements.js`

4. **Easy Setup**: Just run `setup.bat` and follow the prompts

## 📝 How to Use

### Setting Up

1. Run `setup.bat` to set up the bot environment
2. Edit the `.env` file with your Discord credentials:
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   ADMIN_ROLE_ID=your_admin_role_id_here
   LOG_CHANNEL_ID=your_log_channel_id_here
   ANNOUNCEMENT_CHANNEL_ID=your_announcements_channel_id_here
   GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_id_here
   ```
3. Run `start.bat` to start the bot

### Creating Announcements

Simply post messages in your designated announcement channel, and the bot will:
1. Process the message
2. Add a ✅ reaction to indicate success
3. Save the announcement to the website

### Testing Without Discord

If you want to test the website without connecting to Discord:
1. Run `node generate-test-announcements.js` to create sample announcements
2. Open your website to see the announcements displayed

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. Replace the placeholder Discord token in your `.env` file with your actual bot token
2. Run the bot with `start.bat` to make it operational
3. Verify slash commands are registered by typing `/` in your Discord server
